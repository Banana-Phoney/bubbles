# bubbles
Raspberry Pi, Python bubble machine.

On my version i have used a Raspberry Pi Zero since that was what i had laying around. Also Python is what i am familiar with.

Parts are:
1 x Raspberry Pi Zero - i like to use Python and have been slow to order something like ESP32.
1 X MG90S Servo - generic.
1 x 3V to 6V motor - generic.
1 x 5V Relay board - used to keep the motor on its own circuit.
1 x 5V 2.1A powerbank - This powers the Pi, Servo and Relay.
1 x 3.6V 2000 mAh 18650 li ion battery - This is added to drive the motor. I got problems trying to drive everything including the motor from one batteri pack.
